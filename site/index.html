      Organizations increasingly rely upon small groups and teams as the locus of work (Mathieu, Hollenbeck, Van Knippenberg, & Ilgen, 2017). However, we are often surprised by which teams perform well and which do not, since we lack good tools for predicting group performance. By contrast, for over 100 years, psychology has had good tools for predicting many kinds of individual performance, including— especially—individual intelligence tests (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998). Despite controversy about what causes individual intelligence or whether intelligence tests are systematically biased against certain groups, the ability of individual IQ scores to predict an individual’s future performance on a wide range of mental tasks remains one of the most replicated results in all of psychology (Deary, 2012).

      This is a Theodore Roosevelt quote. Tell the browser how large the image is going to be (specify it in the tag) so that it knows before loading the contents how much space to reserve for the image. Otherwise there is going to be some jumping as the page is loaded, in particular when internet bandwidth is low.
